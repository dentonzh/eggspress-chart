## Eggspress Chart ðŸ“Š

Eggspress Chart is a component that lets you add charts to your [Eggspress website](https://github.com/dentonzh/eggspress). Under the hood, it uses [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/) and [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

## Installing

Download the zip archive for this repository [using this link](https://github.com/dentonzh/eggspress-chart/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). 

Alternatively, you can click on the "Code" button near the top of the [repository page](https://github.com/dentonzh/eggspress-chart) and click the "Download Zip" button that appears in the menu that appears.

Extract the contents of the zip file to your `my_components` workspace folder. Create this folder if it does not exist.

## How to use

To insert a chart, you must first prepare your data. Eggspress Chart reads **CSV files** that most spreadsheet applications and statistical packages support.

Place your CSV files in the `my_data` folder of your workspace. Create this folder if it does not exist.

In the content section of a content file, create a new empty line where you would like to insert a chart and writing a Chart tag:

```markdown

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In gravida libero id molestie volutpat...

<Chart filename="2024-01-records.csv">**Figure 1.** Records for January 2024</Chart>

```

You must include the filename property and pass the filename of the CSV file you'd like to use. This file must exist in the `my_data` folder.

You can also pass in additional Markdown content in between the opening (`<Chart>`) and closing (`</Chart>`) tags. This is optional.


For detailed usage instructions including a list of all available properties and options, read the [Eggspress Chart docs](https://eggspress.org/blog/eggspress-chart).

> **Important:** You must have both an opening tag and a closing tag when inserting components like Eggspress Chart.

## Removing Eggspress Chart

To remove Eggspress Chart, remove all `<Chart>` tags in your content and delete the file `my_components/Chart.tsx` and the folder `my_components/Chart`.

Alternatively, you can rename the main component file `my_components/Chart.tsx` to `my_components/#Chart.tsx`. This has the effect of replacing all of your `<Chart>` tags with empty elements. It also prevents `<Chart>` from installing any dependencies during build. This is useful if you have many `<Chart>` tags throughout your site where removing these elements would be time consuming and tedious.
